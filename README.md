# travel-site-dashboard
This is a sample dashboard for a hypothetical travelsite made using basic HTML and CSS. The HTML is split into 4 parts - navbar, header, main, and footer - and positioned using the CSS grid feature. The main container is further subdivided into a left and right side which contain trip articles and announcements, respectively. These are also positioned using CSS grid. Icons for the navbar and header are loaded from jsDelivr.net. A preview is shown below:
